# google_cloud_platform_dns
Python API script to make updates to your DNS zone files hosted with Google Cloud Platform - Cloud DNS

Replace the serviceaccountcredential_json.key file with your own Service Account JSON Key file that you need to generate within your Google Cloud Platform account.


You'll need to update the script and change the following lines to reflect your own project and zone file name (as defined in your Google Cloud Platform account):

project = 'ENTER_PROJECT_NAME'
managedZone = 'ENTER_ZONE_NAME'
